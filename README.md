# Classification-of-normal-vs-tumor-samples


The aim of this notebook is to download the TCGA GRCh38 Breast Cancer gene expression data from the GenoSurf interface and analyse them using different machine learning techniques in order to classify normal and tumor samples.
With this purpose different classification techniques of machine learning have been used such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors.
